Hi, I'm **ogyrec** (Danil), an indie developer, technical enthusiast, and lifelong learner.

## Who am I?

I'm an indie game developer and simulation tinkerer passionate about open source, self-education, and pushing technical boundaries. 
My main focus is **voxel engines, game design, neural networks, and emergent AI**. 
My primary languages are **Rust**, **Python**, **GDScript**, and a bit of **Lua** (mostly from earlier Roblox scripting). Right now, Rust is my main tool - I've picked it up quickly, and most of my core logic is written in it.

## Background

I got into game dev with a Minecraft-inspired multiplayer project, then moved on to building voxel games and engines in **Godot** (over 3000 hours). 
My experience includes everything from GDScript scripting to optimizing with Rust via GDExtension. 
Over time, I shifted almost entirely to Rust for both performance and code clarity, gradually moving from Godot to **Bevy** as my needs outgrew the editor.

## Current Projects

I'm working on **[TerraVox](https://discord.gg/zKY3Tkk837)**, a hardcore voxel sandbox/survival game focused on:
- **Deep world generation**
- **Data-driven modding**
- **Biomes, genetics & mutations**
- **Flexible survival/creative modes**
- **Modular AI, including neuroevolution (optional, but well-optimized for CPUs/GPUs)**
- **Reputation, clan systems, and emergent diplomacy**
- **Multiplayer from day one**

The engine is written in **Rust**, using Bevy for rendering and ECS, but most systems are my own pure Rust code.  
The goal: a world where you can survive, build, mod, experiment, or just wander.

## Technical interests

- Neural networks & neuroevolution (custom NEAT implementation in Rust & Python)
- Simulation (AI agents, RL, WorldBox-style emergent worlds)
- Low-level graphics (voxel rendering, custom chunk systems, shaders, optimization)
- Open source, knowledge sharing, and minimal reliance on big platforms
- Automation (Discord bots, scripting, long-term memory AI, voice/text agents, etc.)

## Inspirations

Mostly inspired by **Vintage Story** (huge respect to Tyron!), Minecraft (especially with mechanical mods like Create), and WorldBox.  
Love deep technical dives, procedural systems, and seeing emergent behavior in action.

## Philosophy

I'm strongly against "the Matrix" - surveillance, corporate overreach, and the erosion of privacy and individual freedom.  
**create, share, stay free** - that's my motto.  
I believe in open source, transparency, and making tech that empowers, not enslaves.

I'm passionate about **sharing knowledge and helping others** - that's why I created this site, write devlogs, and actively support and mentor anyone interested in these topics.  
If you have questions or want to discuss anything technical, feel free to reach out!


## Fun facts

- My first mobile game (built with Godot) hit #1 in Play Market (CIS region) for two weeks.
- I also compose music & soundtracks.
- Iâ€™ve released (and abandoned) many experimental projects; only a few reached the public, but I'm working to open-source more soon.
- I spend at least 8 hours a day (sometimes 12+) on TerraVox and related tech.
- Plan to release some TerraVox systems, NEAT, simulation tools and other projects open-source.
